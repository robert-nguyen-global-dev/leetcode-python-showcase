        """
        Internal implementation.  
        Computes the perimeter of the island represented in the grid.

        Approach:
        - Traverse each cell in the grid.
        - For each land cell (1), start with 4 edges.
        - Subtract 1 edge for each neighboring land cell (up and left only to avoid double-counting).
        - Accumulate the total perimeter.

        Time Complexity: O(m * n) â€” where m, n are grid dimensions.  
        Space Complexity: O(1) â€” constant extra space.

        Args:
            grid (List[List[int]]): 2D grid with 0 = water, 1 = land.

        Returns:
            int: Total perimeter of the island.
