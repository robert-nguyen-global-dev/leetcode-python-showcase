## Structure

- Problems are organized by difficulty:
    - `easy/`
    - `medium/`
    - `hard/`
- Each problem has its own folder:
    ```
    easy/0001_two_sum/
        ├── two_sum.py
        └── test_two_sum.py
    ```
- Each folder contains:
    - A clean Python solution.
    - Unit tests for validation and practice.

---

## Running Tests

🚀 To run all tests:
```bash
python -m unittest discover
```
🚀 To test a specific problem:
```bash
python -m unittest easy/0001_two_sum/test_two_sum.py
```
